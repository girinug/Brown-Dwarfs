# Brown Dwarfs

This is not full file of my thesis, it is only the basic part for my thesis

### Conclusion

1.  Brown dwarfs with heavier mass and lower mean molecular weight per electron
    (higher hydrogen fraction) will have higher central temperature and vice versa

2.  Maximum Central Temperature has linear relation with mass and mean
    molecular weight per electron
