# Brown Dwarfs

This is not full file of my thesis, it is only the basic part for my thesis

### Conclusion

1.  Brown dwarfs with heavier mass and lower mean molecular weight per electron
    (higher hydrogen fraction) will have higher central temperature and vice versa

2.  Maximum Central Temperature has linear relation with mass and mean
    molecular weight per electron

3.  With repeating different value of mass, Hydrogen fraction (x) and linear regression. 
    We get the equation relation between mass, mean molecular weight per electron and 
    maximum central temperature
    
    ##### Tcm = -953488.5194*(µe)^(-2/3) + 53261932.44*(µe^(-2/3))*(M/Mo)
    or
    ##### Tcm = 125979527.2*(M/Mo)^(4/3) - 34965609.96*((M/Mo)^(4/3))*µe
    
    ##### Tcm = Maximum central temperature (K)
    ##### µe = Mean molecular weight per electron
    ##### M = Mass (Mo)
